STAPL - Examples
=====================

This project provides examples of using STAPL and all its features. STAPL is a simple Scala DSL designed to express and evaluate attribute-based tree-structured policies (think XACML) easily.

For more information about STAPL in general, see the [main STAPL project][1].
